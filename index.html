    <h4>The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE Main) comprises of two papers.<br>
         The Paper1 is conducted for admission to Undergraduate Engineering Programs (B.E/B. Tech) at <br>NITs, IIITs, other Centrally  Funded Technical Institutions (CFTIs), Institutions/Universities<br> funded/recognized by participating State Governments, as well as an eligibility test for<br> JEE (Advanced), which is conducted for admission to IITs.<br>
        
         The JEE (Main) is being conducted in multiple Sessions (February/March/April/May 2021) for <br>  admissions in the next academic session. The candidates will thus benefit in the following ways:<br>

         <ol type="1">
             <li>This will give multiple opportunities to the candidates to improve their scores in the <br>examination if they fail to give their best in the first attempt without wasting their whole academic year.<br></li>
             <li>In first attempt, the students will get a first-hand experience of taking an <br>examination and will know their mistakes which they can improve while attempting for the next time.<br></li>
             <li>This will reduce the chances of dropping a year and droppers would not have to waste a<br> full year.<br></li>
             <li>If anyone missed the examination due to reasons beyond control, then he/she will not <br>have to wait for one full year.<br></li><br>

             The studentâ€™s best of the 2021 NTA Scores will be considered for preparation of <br>Merit List/ Ranking.
         </ol>
